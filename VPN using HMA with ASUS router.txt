Setting the VPN with the ASUS router and HMA (Hide My Ass)

A: The modem needs to be setup to support a VPN with a specific VPN IP address
B: The HMA website is used to determine the correct VPN Address, which needs to be selected among several Servers

A: Modem
The IP address we have now is the default: 192.168.1.1usr/pwd are the default as well: admin/admin
The last time I modified the login to the modem to admin/Smcecq8a

The instructions on how to setup the modem are clearly explained in this website:

B: HMA
The HMA site is: https://vpn.hidemyass.com/vpncontrol/signin
usr/pwd is rnmisrahi/Uladi111




The HMA site refers to this site and explains how to go about selecting the VPN we want to use.
The name of the HMA server has this form: <state>.us.hma.rocks or random.<state>.us.hma.rocks, like
al.us.hma.rocks for Alabama or
random.us.ca.hma.rocks

The username/password to select a Server is: rnmisrahi/SVyQmhXd
