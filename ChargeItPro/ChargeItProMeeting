Meeting with Phil and Anson

Dan Price's proposal to buy the company:
12.5 Million
2.5 down
10 million in 15 years (non-secured)
We agreed that we'll reject his offer.

We remembered that we don't have a partners agreement. So a partner doesn't have to seel if he doesn't want (Drag along rule doesn't apply). 


Revenues this year: 6.4 million
last year: 5 million
29% growth in salaries as well
Profit may remain very much the same.
We had 100 merchants/month last 4 months
We have about 3,000 merchants
We expect to have 3,800 next year

We're signing up all new merchants with Gravity.
We get more money and we have access to the Cloud.
A question raised by Phil: Should we move all our accounts to Gravity?
We discussed about the risk and agreed that Phil would ask our lawyer and see our exposure.
FirstData renewal coming up in March. We hope/expect that they won't lower our percentage because we have not given them merchants in a while. We have been passing them to Gravity. Right now we have about 500 accounts with Gravity.

We spoke throughout the conversation about bringing Geoff Knapp. As a board advisor, perhaps as an investor, etc. He could be the person that would lead the company if something happens to Phil.

We agreed to speak next week (Tuesday Dec 22) and talk about the building.
