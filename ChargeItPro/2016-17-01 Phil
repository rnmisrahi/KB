Phone call with Phil:

Mentioned that selling a minority reduces the share with a "Haircut"
He estimates that I could sell my shares for between 1.3 and 2.2 Million

EBITD: Earnings Before I Taxes abd Depreciation

Geoff:
Came for a whole day. Sounded enthusiastic and willing to fill the place if and when needed.
But Phil feels that Geoff has this thing of getting hyped and then just going away.
He has not called.
G. has lost most of what he invested in China.


We spoke about personnel:
Development:
Sven and Bret deal with marketing and sales
Jim, Joe, Lucas, Ben, MJ and Per???

QA:
Ted, Alex, Spencer and Trevon

Tech Support:
16 people

Anson wants to head Development, and we both agree that's not the best place for him.
An idea was to put him as head of QA and above Aaron in Tech Support.
Anson wants a raise and we agreed to talk about it later.


Gravity:
Tammy (ex Yahoo! manager) will come with 2 programmers to our offices.
They want to use our technology.
Big question mark what and whether we should let them do that.
We don't want to become competitors.
An idea: To absorbe development and at the same time sell them 10% of our company.

Tammy has some good knowledge. For instance, she revealed that First Data has an API that we could use.
They intend to use it with a CRM system they are creating.


Other stuff:
Suggested to buy a book: Leaders Eat Less

We developed a system that can talk to remote hardware through an endpoint.
This is important because the new EMV machines work like that: They do all the processing, we just send them the info.
