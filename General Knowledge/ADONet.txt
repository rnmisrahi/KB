1. What is the difference between dataset and data reader?
		DataReader is used to read the data from database and it is a read and forward 
		only connection oriented architecture during fetch the data from database.
		DataSet is a disconnected orient architecture that means there is no need of 
		active connections during work with datasets and it is a collection of 
		DataTables and relations between tables.

2. What is the use of command object?
		The Command Object in ADO.NET executes SQL statements and Stored Procedures 
		against the data source specified in the C# Connection Object. The Command Object 
		requires an instance of a C# Connection Object for executing the SQL statements.

3. What is Dataset object?
		An ADO.NET DataSet contains a collection of zero or more tables represented by 
		DataTable objects. The DataTableCollection contains all the DataTable objects in 
		a DataSet. A DataTable is defined in the System.Data namespace and represents a 
		single table of memory-resident data.

4. How can we save all data from Dataset?
		ds.AcceptChanges(); //Commits all changes made to the dataset
		ds.WriteXml(<string>); //Writes (saves) the dataset to an Xml file that can be
		retrieved with ds.ReadXml(<string>);
		
4a.	What is the basic use of DataView?
		A DataView enables you to create different views of the data stored in a DataTable, 
		a capability that is often used in data-binding applications. Using a DataView, you 
		can expose the data in a table with different sort orders, and you can filter the 
		data by row state or based on a filter expression.

5. What is the use of Command Builder?
		It's used to generate automatic Update, Insert and Delete queries, but only
		applies to queries for single tables.
	
6. How do you define an integer in SQL Server?
		There is Int16, Int32 and Int64 (SmallInt, Int and BigInt).
