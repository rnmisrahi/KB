Migrations
----------
https://coding.abel.nu/2012/03/ef-migrations-command-reference/

This is a very powerfull tool that helps us update our database as it changes.

The Migrations\Configuration.cs constructor hast to have this line:
        public Configuration()
        {
        		//automatic migrations will be enabled in the scaffolded migrations configuration.
            AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true;
        }

The way we set it to work, after we have created a database is by using the Tools > Nugget Package Manager > Package Manager Console
Her we initialize the migrations by entering
> Enable-Migrations
Then:
> Add-Migration <name>
This Scaffolds a migration script for any pending model changes

> Update-Database
Applies any pending migrations to the database.

> Get-Migrations
Displays the migrations that have been applied to the target database.
