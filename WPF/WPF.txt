WPF: Windows Presentation Foundation
------------------------------------

Foundation: Is a set of libraries

WPF is not totally restricted to desktop apps, because WPF -like any deskptop app- can make 
	WCF calls.

Based on DirectX.
	DirectX was the technology used to provide fast graphics for games. It used hardware capabilities 
	to speed up the rendenring.


Benefits:
- Performance
- It solves the problem of different resolutions
- Separation of UI and code

XAML is compiled before its shown

xmlns is xml name space

It uses dips as "pixels". The width and height of controls are given in dips, which are 1/96 of an inch

There are Content Controls that can contain other controls
It inherits the class ContentControl


Content Controls: They can contain only one control
Window, Button, CheckBox, 

Children Control - They contain several controls
StackPanel (All Panels), Grid

Text Control
Text


ContentControl is an Abstract Class. Nevertheless we can put one in a window.


Attached Property
This is used by Canvas. It has a dictionary for all the controls in it with the attributes Left and Top
There is a dictionary for Left, one for right, etc. for Canvas


Miscellaneous Features:

- Rotation:
	Controls can rotate. For instance:
	  <Button.RenderTransform >
      <RotateTransform Angle="15"/>
    </Button.RenderTransform >
  We can also define the axis, but as a parameter of the control
    Button.RenderTransformOrigin="1,1" //0,0 is the upper left corner, 0,1 lower left

- Within the <Window> element we can link events to controls in general.
	For instance, we can set it as follows:
	<Window ... MouseRightButtonDown="Dialog_RB"...
	and have in the code:
	 void Dialog_RB(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e){
	 		Control source = e.Source as Control;
	 		source.BorderThickness = new Thickness(5);
	 }
	 
	The event can be on specific control types:
	<Window... Button.Click="Button_Click" ListBox.SelectionChanged="Box_Selected" 
	The code would reflect that:
	void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e){...}
	void Box_Selected(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
