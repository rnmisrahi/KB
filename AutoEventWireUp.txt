AutoEventWireup
---------------

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/324151

It's an attribute of the Page. If true, all the event handlers of the Page 
	are called and we can code them. This is convenient but it could use some 
	resources, because all those events are called. Events such as Page_load, 
	Page_init, PreLoad, PreRenderComplete, etc.
	
We can add our own events instead of using AutoventWireUp as follows:
    override protected void OnInit(EventArgs e)
    {
        this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Page_Load);
    }


PreRender is called after Page_Load, which allows us to then "see" the controls
	already loaded.
