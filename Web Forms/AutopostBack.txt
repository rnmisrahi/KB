AutoPostBack

Autopostback is the mechanism, by which the page will be posted 
back to the server automatically based on some events in the web controls.

How can this be used? For instance, a Dropdown list or group of radio buttons where the action requires us
to go to the Server and fill the rest of the screen with additional data, would need to have AutoPostBack=true

Example:
<asp:DropDownList ID="ddlStatus" runat="server" AutoPostBack="true">
