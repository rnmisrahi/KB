PreRender
---------

It's an event of a web form that is called (it's a callback) before the page is rendered.
It Performs any updates before the output is rendered.

The major difference between Page_Load and Page_PreRender is that in the Page_Load method 
	not all of your page controls are completely initialized (loaded), because individual 
	controls Load() methods has not been called yet.
